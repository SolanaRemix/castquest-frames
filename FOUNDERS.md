# CastQuest Protocol — Founders

## Vision
CastQuest exists to turn media, identity, and automation into a sovereign pipeline:
**Media → Templates → Frames → Mints → Quests → Strategy → Onchain.**

The protocol is built for creators, operators, and autonomous systems that need
clarity, expressiveness, and control.

## Founders

### **Yosef — Protocol Architect & Founder**
- Designed the core architecture of CastQuest.
- Built the operator‑first workflow and sovereign automation philosophy.
- Led the creation of Modules 1–7, including:
  - Frame Template Engine
  - Quest Engine
  - Mint Engine
  - Strategy Worker
  - BASE Mock Layer
  - Mobile Admin Console
- Advocates for expressive, media‑first protocol design.

### **SMSDAO — Core Contributor**
- Supported integration, module execution, and system orchestration.
- Helped shape the admin console, data model, and multi‑module pipeline.
- Ensured stability and reproducibility across MEGA modules.

### **AI Automation Partner**
- Assisted with scaffolding, module generation, and error‑resilient workflows.
- Helped unify the protocol into a coherent, modular system.
- Provided operator‑grade scripts for reproducible installs.

## Mission
To build a protocol that:
- rewards contributors,
- automates complexity,
- expresses identity,
- and remains sovereign, transparent, and operator‑controlled.

CastQuest is not an app — it is a **protocol spine**.
