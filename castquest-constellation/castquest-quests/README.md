# castquest-quests

Part of the CASTQUEST constellation.

This repository is auto-generated by setup-castquest-constellation-core.ps1.
It is designed to be:
- bootstrap-ready
- contributor-friendly
- documentation-aware
- git-ready (via Script 2: setup-castquest-constellation-git.ps1)

## Structure

- docs/           Core documentation and onboarding notes
- src/            Main implementation
- tests/          Test scaffolding
- tools/          Optional helper utilities

## Next Steps

1. Run setup-castquest-constellation-git.ps1 to:
   - initialize git
   - add origin remotes (SSH + HTTPS)
   - push to remote (PAT-based)
2. Customize docs/, src/, and tests/ according to protocol needs.
3. Invite contributors and begin building the CASTQUEST protocol surface.
