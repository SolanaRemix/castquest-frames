# CAST QUEST Protocol

CAST QUEST is a modular Web3 social protocol built around Frames — JSON-defined interactive units that combine UI, logic, and onchain actions.

Frames:
- Are mini-apps for minting, collecting, quests, games, and airdrops
- Are deterministic: same input -> same decision
- Are portable across web, mobile, admin, and external integrations

The protocol stack:
- Contracts on Base (registry, router, modules)
- Frame runtime (validation, guards, actions)
- Indexer (onchain data)
- Workers (AI, notifications, analytics)
- Smart Brain (multi-agent AI)
