## What is CastQuest?

CastQuest is a sovereign, media-first protocol that turns:

**Media → Templates → Frames → Render → Mints → Quests → Strategy → Onchain**

into an operator-controlled automation spine.

Use these docs to understand the pipeline, extend the protocol, and build new automation and onchain behaviors.
