# CastQuest Protocol — History

## Phase 0 — Conception
The idea for CastQuest emerged from the need for a sovereign, media‑first
automation protocol that could unify frames, quests, mints, and strategy into a
single expressive pipeline.

## Phase 1 — Bootstrap
- Initial repo structure created.
- Admin and web apps scaffolded.
- Media upload pipeline established.

## Phase 2 — Module Expansion

### Module 4 — BASE API + Mobile Admin + Strategy Dashboard
- Added mock onchain layer.
- Introduced ShellLayout for mobile‑friendly admin.
- Added strategy logs and dashboard.

### Module 5B — Quest Engine MEGA
- Full quest model: steps, rewards, progress, triggers.
- Admin pages for creation and management.
- Public quest viewer.
- Strategy integration via `/api/quests/trigger`.

### Module 6 — Frame Template Engine MEGA
- Template creation, editing, and application.
- Admin + web template viewer.
- JSON DB for templates.
- Integration with frames and quests.

### Module 7 — Mint Engine + Renderer + Automation Worker MEGA
- Mint creation, simulation, claiming.
- Frame renderer (mock).
- Worker automation: run, scan, log.
- Full integration with frames, quests, and BASE mock.

## Phase 3 — Protocol Spine
With Modules 4–7 installed, CastQuest became a complete protocol:

**Media → Templates → Frames → Mints → Quests → Strategy → Worker → Onchain**

## Phase 4 — Future
- Real onchain integration.
- Live renderer.
- Contributor badges.
- Multi‑chain support.
- Autonomous strategy agents.
